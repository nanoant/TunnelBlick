# This script downloads and installs new versions of the GNU "autotools" -- a set of
# command line tools that are obsolete in Xcode 3 and are missing from Xcode 4 and higher.
#
# It downloads the following version of each tool (change to download different versions):

readonly autoconf_version=autoconf-2.69
readonly automake_version=automake-1.9
readonly libtool_version=libtool-2.4.5

# It installs the tools to /usr/local/bin. It uses sudo to install because /usr/local/bin
# is a protected folder. So it must be run from an OS X account with administrator
# privileges, and will ask for the the user's password.

# Download and build the tools in the user's "Downloads" folder.
readonly downloads_folder_path=~/Downloads
